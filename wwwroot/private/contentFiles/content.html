                  Willy didn't want to and didn't have to so he refused to let [[that - his grandfather not wanting to live]] happen. He took over the farm chores, feeding the chickens, tending the potatoes, and harnessing his faithful dog, Searchlight, to help him plow the fields. But as he sorted through his grandfather’s papers, he made a terrible discovery. They owed five hundred dollars in taxes, and if they couldn’t pay, they would lose the farm. Desperate to save the only home they had ever known, Willy searched for a way to earn the money—until he heard about the great dogsled race. The prize? Exactly five hundred dollars.
                  
                  It was a fool’s hope. The race was dominated by seasoned competitors, men who had trained their dogs for years. And among them was Stone Fox, the legendary Native American racer who had never lost. Stone Fox raced not for glory, but for something far greater—he was using his winnings to buy back the land that had been taken from his people. He was a man of few words and many victories, and Willy knew that beating him was all but impossible.
                  
                  But Willy had something stronger than experience—he had heart. He and Searchlight trained tirelessly, racing across the snow-covered fields, preparing for the greatest challenge of their lives. When the day of the race arrived, the townspeople chuckled at the sight of a mere boy among the powerful men and their mighty sled dogs. Yet as the race began, Willy and Searchlight surprised everyone. They ran faster and faster, keeping up with racers who should have left them far behind.
                  
                  The race was neck and neck, with Stone Fox leading and Willy close behind. As the finish line came into view, Searchlight gave everything she had, her paws pounding the snow, her breath coming in short, determined bursts. She was going to do it—she was going to win. But just as she took her final stride, she collapsed. Willy fell to his knees beside her, but there was no saving her—his beloved Searchlight was gone.
                  
                  A hush fell over the crowd. Stone Fox, who had fought and won countless races, looked at the small boy kneeling beside his fallen friend. And then, without a word, he did something no one expected. He stopped. He turned to face the other racers and raised a hand. "Anyone who moves," he said, "I shoot."
                  
                  No one dared to cross him. Stone Fox bent down, gently lifted Searchlight’s body, and placed her on the sled. He looked at Willy, his eyes filled with something deep and unspoken, and then he stepped aside. With tears in his eyes, Willy took the sled’s reins and walked across the finish line, claiming the prize—not in triumph, but in sorrow.
                  
                  The farm was saved, but the victory felt hollow. Yet as Willy returned home, his grandfather—who had spent weeks locked in silence—finally spoke. He reached out, pulled Willy close, and for the first time in what felt like forever, he smiled.
                  
                  It was a bittersweet ending, but one that would never be forgotten. Willy had lost his best friend, but he had gained something even greater—a reminder that love, sacrifice, and kindness could change the world.

                  Winter has arrived, and Charlie Bucket's family is struggling more than ever. The cold weather makes their situation worse, as they cannot afford to heat their small house properly. The entire family—Charlie, his parents, and his four grandparents—endures freezing temperatures and extreme hunger.

Charlie’s father, Mr. Bucket, works at a toothpaste factory, screwing caps onto tubes of toothpaste. However, his meager salary is barely enough to buy food for the family. The price of food has risen, making their limited budget stretch even less. Their meals are mostly bread and margarine, with boiled potatoes and cabbage making occasional appearances. Despite this, Charlie’s parents try to give him as much food as possible, often going hungry themselves.

As Charlie grows weaker from hunger, his body begins to thin, and his energy diminishes. The one thing that keeps his spirits up is his daily walk to school, where he passes Wonka’s famous chocolate factory. The sight of the factory and the smell of melting chocolate torment him, making his hunger even more unbearable.

One day, as he walks home from school, Charlie finds a silver coin (a fifty-pence piece) buried in the snow. The sight of it fills him with excitement, as he realizes he can finally buy something to eat. This moment sets up the events of the next chapter, where he will enter a shop and buy a chocolate bar—leading to the discovery of the Golden Ticket that will change his life.

One innovative solution to this problem is urban agriculture, a practice that involves growing food within city environments. This method of farming can take many forms, including rooftop gardens, hydroponic systems, and vertical farming. By utilizing available urban space, proponents argue that urban agriculture can improve food security, reduce environmental impact, and [[enhance - (verb)have better]improve[}test to see what happens when there is no space to the right{]] community well-being.

      One of the main advantages of [[urban agriculture.webp - city farming]vertical or indoor farming[>도시 농업<}rural agriculture, traditional farming{]] is its ability to provide fresh produce to city dwellers. Traditional agriculture often requires transporting food over long distances, which leads to nutrient loss and higher carbon emissions. By contrast, food grown in urban environments can be harvested and consumed within the same day, ensuring better nutritional value while reducing transportation costs and pollution. Additionally, locally grown food can be more affordable because it eliminates the expenses associated with long-distance supply chains.

      Another benefit of urban agriculture is its potential to mitigate environmental problems associated with modern farming. Large-scale agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, water pollution, and soil degradation. In contrast, to urban farming methods like hydroponics and aquaponics use significantly less water and do not require large areas of land. Furthermore, green spaces created by urban gardens can help absorb carbon dioxide, reduce urban heat islands, and improve air quality, leading to healthier living conditions in densely populated areas.

      Despite these advantages, [[urban agriculture.webp - (-urban: adjective    
                                                                -agriculture: noun) city farming]vertical or indoor farming[>도시 농업<]] also faces several challenges. Limited space is a primary concern, as most urban environments lack the vast tracts of land necessary for large-scale farming. Additionally, urban soil may be contaminated with pollutants, requiring extra precautions before planting. There are also regulatory barriers in many cities, where [[zoning laws - (zoning: adj._laws: noun)rules that control how land can be used}land use freedom, unrestricted land use{]] and building codes may restrict farming activities. Finally, the initial investment for high-tech farming solutions such as vertical farms can be substantial, making it difficult for small-scale farmers to participate.

      In conclusion, urban agriculture presents a promising approach 끔to [[address.webp - (verb)understanding and doing something about]] food security and environmental concerns in cities. While there are obstacles to its widespread adoption, technological advancements and supportive policies may help overcome these barriers. As cities continue to expand, the integration of agriculture into urban planning may become an essential strategy for sustainable development.

—
The extractor’s part-rusting mechanical arm winds out over the frozen ground, over a sprawling lunar landscape of unnatural colors. [[Earth.jpg - globe]]The mining of titanium has a greater urgency than ever, here in Irshansk.
The electricity that powers the vast machines is only sometimes on for three hours a day. But resources like titanium are potentially key to the moonshot rare earth minerals deal that is suddenly the focus of talking peace in Ukraine. The deal’s signatories, the United States and Ukraine, appear to have opposing interpretations of its terms, which leave many thorny details for a later discussion.
Some current and former US officials have cast doubt on President Donald Trump’s claim that the potential deal he is on the verge of signing with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky would offer the US easy access to a plethora of rare earth minerals.
Much of what does exist will be difficult to exploit, particularly at a time of war.
And from this beleaguered mine in the northwestern town of Irshansk, it is hard to see how Ukraine could, in this lifetime, get to the half a trillion dollars Trump has suggested they might repay.
“Now we don’t know what and how our work will go on even tomorrow”, said Dmytro Holik, director of mining and concentrating plant at Ukrainian conglomerate Group DF.

What we do and don’t know about Trump’s ‘very big deal’ on Ukraine’s mineral resources
“Every day we see how Ukraine’s energy system is being destroyed. Every day, entire regions are cut off in an emergency,” he added, a reference to the waves of drones and missiles Russia pounds Ukrainian homes and energy infrastructure with each night.
The plant’s staff are mostly men, kept away from conscription as titanium is considered a critical industry. Profits are low, prospects dim. “Our enterprise is now very unstable, and this leads to a very high cost of our products,” Holik said.
The proposed minerals bonanza now at the heart of continued US aid to Ukraine in the largest war in Europe since the 1940s, seems to speak to a fantastical future world of prosperity.
Trump on Thursday held out the possibility of American personnel in Ukraine working to extract minerals once a mineral resources deal - and peace - was in effect.
“When you talk about economic development, we’re going to have a lot of people over there,” he said. “So we’ll be working in the country. So I just don’t think you’re going to have a problem.”
Opaque deal
The nature of the framework deal - which, according to a text seen by CNN Wednesday morning to be signed by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukranian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎ - is as opaque as elements of the industry they seek to harness.
It refers to half the value of “relevant Ukrainian Government-owned natural resource assets,” but says the specific details will be “agreed by both Participants, as may be further described in the Fund Agreement.” The deal goes on to say these won’t include “current sources of revenues… already part of the budget revenues of Ukraine.”
The extent of Ukraine’s mineral wealth is unclear.[[Earth.jpg - globe]]
Ukrainian officials accept they sometimes rely on Soviet-era geological dating. Yet in a recent presentation by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, Kyiv claimed 7% of the world’s titanium production, and to have 3% of the lithium reserves – which have not been mined yet. It also said Ukraine was in the top five nations of graphite reserves, and had deposits of the rare earth minerals tantalum, niobium and beryllium.

The numbers resemble those in the Ukraine chapter of the US Geological Survey’s 2020-2021 Minerals Yearbook, written before Russia’s full-scale invasion disrupted production. The USGS said at the time that Ukraine was the fifth-ranked producer of titanium sponge, and the sixth largest producer of graphite.
A USGS mineral commodity summary for 2025 had no figure for graphite reserves, and said, among other observations, that Ukraine was a source of the rare earth metal scandium and had shuttered a 1.7 million-ton a year alumina refinery since 2022.
Natalia Bariatska, a doctor of geology and member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists, said critical raw materials were all at different stages of research and exploration.
“It is very difficult to talk about the actual value of these deposits,” Bariatska said. “We can speak about the value of the elements in the subsoil, but we have to understand it takes a lot of investment to extract, process and sell them.”

While the framework deal leaves it unclear what assets will be impacted by any future fund, US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz made an explicit reference during a White House briefing on February 20 to one Ukrainian “aluminum foundry.”
“It’s been damaged, it is not at its current capacity, if restored it would account for America’s entire imports of aluminum for an entire year,” Waltz said.
Waltz did not name the foundry, and the White House did not respond to a request for clarification at the time of publication. But the most likely facility he was referring to is the Zaporizhzhia industrial aluminum integrated plant.
Mothballed a decade ago, a video of the plant released by Ukrainian investigators in 2015 shows it in significant disrepair. It is since running on a much-reduced staff, and has been hit by a missile, according to a filing with the State Property Fund of Ukraine.

I like to [[slumber(verb) - sleep(snooze, doze, nap)(자다)]].Donald Trump isn’t the only president who knows a bad deal when he sees one.
Volodymyr Zelensky’s refusal to sign away nearly half of his country’s rare earth minerals for very few future guarantees is one of many reasons why Trump has been driven into a rage at his counterpart in Kyiv.
The Ukrainian president has made clear that exploiting his country’s precious geographical and energy resources will be one way to rebuild its economy and cities after the eventual end of the war. But the offer tendered by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, while being lauded by US officials as a generous ladder to prosperity for Ukraine, is not really a “deal” at all.
However, it provides insights into Trump’s view of foreign policy and his perception of the war after he reversed, rhetorically at least, the Biden administration’s support for the invaded party and threw his weight behind the invader.
As with his plan to relocate all Palestinians out of Gaza so the US can build a “riviera” of beach resorts, the president’s motives appear to be rooted more in extracting the best potential monetary return for the United States than in equitably solving a murderous conflict that endangers the world. Trump is reflecting skepticism among his base voters toward the tens of billions of dollars of military and financial aid that the Biden administration sent to Ukraine after it was illegally invaded by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces three years ago. But Trump’s transactional approach represents a shattering of foreign policy values pursued by the United States for decades, including the principle that mighty nations should not invade smaller ones, which Washington enshrined in the United Nations charter.
His pressure on Ukraine, the victim in the conflict, is also a hardline effort to take advantage of a nation in its darkest hour. While Putin has carved off large chunks of its territory, Trump seeks a large slice of its mineral wealth at a knockdown price. The “deal” looks rather like a form of extortion that Trump tried on Zelensky once before — floating military aid as an incentive for him to announce an investigation into Joe Biden, which led to Trump’s first impeachment.
Still, the White House says Zelensky has no choice but to sign the pact to pay back US taxpayers for Kyiv’s lifeline — even though it contains no assurances that Washington will keep the aid coming in the future.
“President Trump is obviously very frustrated right now with President Zelensky,” White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said on Thursday. “The fact that he hasn’t come to the table, that he hasn’t been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered – I think he eventually will get to that point, and I hope so very quickly.”
A staggering US reversal
The clash over the rare earth minerals agreement comes amid a serious deterioration of US relations with Zelensky, driven by Trump’s adoption of Russian propaganda on the war, including the false charges that the Ukrainian leader started the conflict and that he is a dictator. The autocrat in this situation is Putin, who has run Russia for 25 years, imprisoned his opponents, crushed the free press and held sham elections. And he started the war.
The staggering US reversal on the war deepened Thursday as the Trump administration haggled with G7 members over a joint statement marking the invasion’s third anniversary, with US diplomats resisting a mention of “Russian aggression” in the document. Officials told CNN that other G7 members fear handing Russia yet another win, following the US siding with Putin over some of his demands on an eventual peace before this week’s talks in Saudi Arabia.
While Trump says he is convinced that Putin wants to stop the war and is serious about talking peace, US and allied intelligence agencies are less bullish. Three sources familiar with Western intelligence told CNN’s Katie Bo Lillis and Natasha Bertrand that Putin remains fixated on either subsuming Ukraine into Russia or ensuring a small, weak state that is dependent on Moscow. “If you were to get a ceasefire, then a ceasefire is just time for Putin to take a rest and rearm and come back and get the rest of what he wants,” said one of the sources. “We’ve seen no indications whatsoever that his ambitions have changed.”
The events of the last few days, which have left Ukrainians feeling betrayed, US allies alarmed, and even some Republican senators outraged, have renewed debate about Trump’s motives and how they will influence the chances of a fair peace deal.
Is the president being driven by personal animosity toward Zelensky? Or contempt for a smaller nation in need, as he seeks to reorient US foreign policy to promote a spheres of influence system controlled at superpower summits by strongmen like himself, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping?
Or is Trump, as he often has before, choosing a hardline position simply to create negotiating room for himself? Could his adoption of many of Putin’s talking points and leaning hard on Zelensky be designed to lure the Russian president to the table for a tough bargaining session? Certainly, Trump’s good relationship with Putin could position him, more than any other Western leader, to influence Russia’s conduct and potentially extract concessions.
A peace that endures; permits Ukraine to continue existing as independent, sovereign state; avoids rewarding Putin’s expansionism; and saves millions of lives would be a huge legacy achievement for Trump. The current war of words between Washington and Kyiv does not preclude an eventual and serious negotiation — and will soon be forgotten if a peace can be brokered. Still, Trump is yet to show evidence that he’s drafting a clever plan to call the Kremlin’s bluff. Trump’s wild words often cause his critics to overreact, but words are important in this case — since the president is obscuring the basic facts about what caused the war, which is a fundamental flaw in a leader who is positioning himself to lead peace negotiations.
Trump’s parroting of many of Putin’s positions has also renewed debate about his fascination with the Russian leader, which, in his first term, saw him publicly repudiate his own intelligence agencies’ assessments that Russia meddled in the 2016 election.
Trump’s latest favoritism toward Putin drew a raw public and emotional rebuke from a key Republican senator facing reelection in 2026. North Carolina’s Thom Tillis said he agreed with most of the president’s instincts on national security but added: “Whoever believes that there is any space for Vladimir Putin and the future of a stable globe, better go to Ukraine, they better go to Europe.” Tillis went on about Putin: “They better invest the time to understand that this man is a cancer and the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime. And it will be a cancer that spreads into the South China Sea, into Taiwan and metastasized across the globe.”
Why Zelensky couldn’t accept the ‘deal’
The proposed minerals deal raises questions not just about its terms but also the White House’s understanding of the political dynamics in Ukraine.
How to Make a Jjajangmyeon Alternative with Your Ingredients
Ingredients (from what you have)
삼겹살 (Pork belly) – for the meaty base
양파 (Onion) – a must-have for sweetness
당근 (Carrot) – adds texture
간장 (Soy sauce) – for umami and saltiness
된장 (Doenjang) – to add fermented depth (substitute for 춘장)
설탕 (Sugar) – balances flavors
Olive oil / Corn oil – for frying
Black pepper – seasoning
Flour – to thicken the sauce
Spaghetti pasta – substitute for noodles
Steps
Prepare the sauce base:
Dice 삼겹살 and cook it in corn oil until crispy.
Add chopped 양파 and 당근, then stir-fry until soft.
Add 1 tbsp 된장 + 1 tbsp 간장 and stir well.
Add ½ tbsp sugar and a little black pepper for balance.
Thicken the sauce:
Make a flour slurry (mix 1 tbsp flour + 3 tbsp water) and add it to the pan. Stir until it thickens.
Cook the noodles:
Boil spaghetti until al dente, drain, and rinse with cold water.
Combine:
Pour the sauce over the noodles and mix well.
What to Expect?
It won’t be exactly 짜장면, but the 된장 + 간장 + sugar + flour combo will create a similar savory, slightly sweet, thick sauce.
The 삼겹살, onions, and carrots will give it a familiar texture.
The spaghetti will work as a noodle replacement.
Optional Enhancements
If you have potatoes or cabbage, they would be great additions.
A fried egg on top would be delicious.

There’s no way that Zelensky or any other Ukrainian president could have accepted the “deal” to hand over much of his country’s geological inheritance and a key to its future economic viability. If he had, his approval rating probably would tumble near to the 4% level that Trump falsely claims it’s already at as he demands that Zelensky hold an election, which has been delayed because of martial law amid Russian attacks. Appreciating Zelensky’s political situation is crucial, because any peace is going to be a painful pill that the Ukrainian leader will have to convince his country to swallow since it is almost certain to enshrine Russia’s hold on stolen territory.
Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference last weekend that he’d not allowed one of his ministers to sign the first draft of the minerals deal with the United States. “The agreement is not ready to protect us or our interests,” he told reporters, noting that he did not see how the draft provided security guarantees for Ukraine.
But it’s still possible that the first US attempt at a deal could provide the framework for a future agreement. Zelensky hasn’t, for example, ruled out an agreement. But he is seeking to use the leverage of his country’s resources to obtain the security guarantees that Ukraine needs to survive after any peace deal.
The original rare earth mineral deal focused on compensating the United States for past aid to Kyiv, and specified the natural resources that would form part of the deal on over a dozen pages, two sources familiar with the document told CNN. Zelensky said Wednesday the contract asked for the US to own, or receive revenue from, 50% of Ukraine rare earth mineral mining and other natural resource sectors. The sources said the document said it asked for compensation not for future US assistance to Ukraine, but for previous aid.
Speaking on Fox News on Thursday morning, Waltz said it was time to for Ukraine to stop “bad-mouthing” Trump because of all the good he and the United States had done for the country. “It’s unacceptable. They need to tone it down and take a hard look and sign that deal,” he said.
While Ukraine’s language has been spicy in recent days — Zelensky accused the US president of dwelling in a “disinformation space” — most of the heightened rhetoric followed Trump’s own false claims and accusations.
In the United States and Europe, the furor provoked by Trump’s turn against Ukraine is a political issue. But for Ukrainians it’s a matter of life and death.
“Ukrainians feel like they are the only adults left in the room,” Sasha Dovzhyk, director of the Institute for Documentation and Exchange, told Paula Newton on CNN International. “What we have currently in the news is tantrums from someone we considered a world leader, and Ukrainians are basically left to face up to the deconstruction of the world order.”
[[Eaaharth - globe]]She added: “We are not new to this fight; the only addition is that currently we are facing aggression and misinformation from another side — which is the side of our great ally the United States of America.”

  I like to [[slumber(verb)-sleep(snooze, doze, nap)(자다)]].Donald Trump isn’t the only president who knows a bad deal when he sees one.
  Volodymyr Zelensky’s refusal to sign away nearly half of his country’s rare earth minerals for very few future guarantees is one of many reasons why Trump has been driven into a rage at his counterpart in Kyiv.
  The Ukrainian president has made clear that exploiting his country’s precious geographical and energy resources will be one way to rebuild its economy and cities after the eventual end of the war. But the offer tendered by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, while being lauded by US officials as a generous ladder to prosperity for Ukraine, is not really a “deal” at all.
  However, it provides insights into Trump’s view of foreign policy and his perception of the war after he reversed, rhetorically at least, the Biden administration’s support for the invaded party and threw his weight behind the invader.
  As with his plan to relocate all Palestinians out of Gaza so the US can build a “riviera” of beach resorts, the president’s motives appear to be rooted more in extracting the best potential monetary return for the United States than in equitably solving a murderous conflict that endangers the world. Trump is reflecting skepticism among his base voters toward the tens of billions of dollars of military and financial aid that the Biden administration sent to Ukraine after it was illegally invaded by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces three years ago. But Trump’s transactional approach represents a shattering of foreign policy values pursued by the United States for decades, including the principle that mighty nations should not invade smaller ones, which Washington enshrined in the United Nations charter.
  His pressure on Ukraine, the victim in the conflict, is also a hardline effort to take advantage of a nation in its darkest hour. While Putin has carved off large chunks of its territory, Trump seeks a large slice of its mineral wealth at a knockdown price. The “deal” looks rather like a form of extortion that Trump tried on Zelensky once before — floating military aid as an incentive for him to announce an investigation into Joe Biden, which led to Trump’s first impeachment.
  Still, the White House says Zelensky has no choice but to sign the pact to pay back US taxpayers for Kyiv’s lifeline — even though it contains no assurances that Washington will keep the aid coming in the future.
  “President Trump is obviously very frustrated right now with President Zelensky,” White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said on Thursday. >사진사진<“The fact that he hasn’t come to the table, that he hasn’t been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered – I think he eventually will get to that point, and I hope so very quickly.”
  A staggering US reversal
  The clash over the rare earth minerals agreement comes amid a serious deterioration of US relations with Zelensky, driven by Trump’s adoption of Russian propaganda on the war, including the false charges that the Ukrainian leader started the conflict and that he is a dictator. The autocrat in this situation is Putin, who has run Russia for 25 years, imprisoned his opponents, crushed the free press and held sham elections. And he started the war.
  The staggering US reversal on the war deepened Thursday as the Trump administration haggled with G7 members over a joint statement marking the invasion’s third anniversary, with US diplomats resisting a mention of “Russian aggression” in the document. Officials told CNN that other G7 members fear handing Russia yet another win, following the US siding with Putin over some of his demands on an eventual peace before this week’s talks in Saudi Arabia.
  While Trump says he is convinced that Putin wants to stop the war and is serious about talking peace, US and allied intelligence agencies are less bullish. Three sources familiar with Western intelligence told CNN’s Katie Bo Lillis and Natasha Bertrand that Putin remains fixated on either subsuming Ukraine into Russia or ensuring a small, weak state that is dependent on Moscow. “If you were to get a ceasefire, then a ceasefire is just time for Putin to take a rest and rearm and come back and get the rest of what he wants,” said one of the sources. “We’ve seen no indications whatsoever that his ambitions have changed.”
  The events of the last few days, which have left Ukrainians feeling betrayed, US allies alarmed, and even some Republican senators outraged, have renewed debate about Trump’s motives and how they will influence the chances of a fair peace deal.
  Is the president being driven by personal animosity toward Zelensky? Or contempt for a smaller nation in need, as he seeks to reorient US foreign policy to promote a spheres of influence system controlled at superpower summits by strongmen like himself, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping?
  Or is Trump, as he often has before, choosing a hardline position simply to create negotiating room for himself? Could his adoption of many of Putin’s talking points and leaning hard on Zelensky be designed to lure the Russian president to the table for a tough bargaining session? Certainly, Trump’s good relationship with Putin could position him, more than any other Western leader, to influence Russia’s conduct and potentially extract concessions.
  A peace that endures; permits Ukraine to continue existing as independent, sovereign state; avoids rewarding Putin’s expansionism; and saves millions of lives would be a huge legacy achievement for Trump. The current war of words between Washington and Kyiv does not preclude an eventual and serious negotiation — and will soon be forgotten if a peace can be brokered. Still, Trump is yet to show evidence that he’s drafting a clever plan to call the Kremlin’s bluff. Trump’s wild words often cause his critics to overreact, but words are important in this case — since the president is obscuring the basic facts about what caused the war, which is a fundamental flaw in a leader who is positioning himself to lead peace negotiations.
  Trump’s parroting of many of Putin’s positions has also renewed debate about his fascination with the Russian leader, which, in his first term, saw him publicly repudiate his own intelligence agencies’ assessments that Russia meddled in the 2016 election.
  Trump’s latest favoritism toward Putin drew a raw public and emotional rebuke from a key Republican senator facing reelection in 2026. North Carolina’s Thom Tillis said he agreed with most of the president’s instincts on national security but added: “Whoever believes that there is any space for Vladimir Putin and the future of a stable globe, better go to Ukraine, they better go to Europe.” Tillis went on about Putin: “They better invest the time to understand that this man is a cancer and the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime. And it will be a cancer that spreads into the South China Sea, into Taiwan and metastasized across the globe.”

April 8: if qBtn clicked rapidly, multiple question-containers were being created. to prevent that !document.querySelector('#text-container > #question-container') makes sure text-container does not have a child named Q-container b4 creating a Q-container
April 12: [\w\W]+?   making it lazy match if possible requires less steps
April 24: if mousedown is used, then contextmenu will sometimes miss .vocab and register .vocab's parent as the click. So gotta change contextmenu to mousedown
April 27: An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor with a position other than static, 
          or to the initial containing block (usually the <html> or <body> element) if no positioned ancestor exists.
          - The element is removed from the normal document flow, meaning it doesn’t affect the positioning of other elements.
          - You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to precisely position the element within its containing block.

May 1: When you remove an element from the DOM (e.g., via .remove() or .replaceChildren()), its event listeners are not explicitly removed. 
       However, if nothing in your code holds a reference to that element or its listener functions, then the garbage collector will eventually clean up both the element and its listeners
May 20: Fixed issue with multiple choice cards not resizing by adding '|| multChoiceQon' on window.addEventListener('resize',. Put mouseup and mousedown in mouseenter on kVocab, same format as qVocab and vocabs in kText, qText, and displayMCs work well. before, kVocab would think qVocab was its own and respond accordingly. i.e. It would try to display it's 6th word because qVocab's 6th word was right clicked, and leftPic would try to display kVocab's 6th word
June 16: if mouse scroll changes text using innerHTML, the element in the DOM is being replaced with another element. So the browser will treat that as mouseenter even though the mouse didn't move, because technically the mouse did enter into a new element even though the use doesn't notice it.
July 6:         vocab.addEventListener('mouseleave', addAnsBtns, { once: true });     passing the function itself, not calling it.   browser automatically passes the MouseEvent to your function when 'mouseleave' happens
                vocab.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => addAnsBtns(), { once: true });
                Both will execute when the mouseleave event happens on vocab

                vocab.addEventListener('mouseleave', addAnsBtns(), { once: true });    addAnsBtns() will be called immediately on runtime
