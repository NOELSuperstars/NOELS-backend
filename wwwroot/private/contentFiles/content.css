 Problem: Readers when reading can easily lose their place, skip a line, lose focus, or struggle reading small font.
 My app solves all these issues with convenience and simplicity.

 Title: Traverse throughout an entire reading text with an emphasized isolated piece of text that is linked to pictures/gifs
 What: A single piece of text (usually a whole sentence) from the entire text gets isolated and highlighted and the user can traverse through the entire text by 
    1) hovering over a text element container, which only holds that piece of text, and then by scrolling up the current sentence moves up and disappears while the next 
    sentence appears from the bottom and moves up and vice versa, sort of like a slot machine,
    2) or by clicking on different areas of a large container which holds as many sentences as it can, and the sentence that was clicked gets highlighted,
    3) or by pressing the left and right arrow keys. Imagine reading a book and the current sentence you are reading gets highlighted. When you move on to the next sentence, 
    that sentence gets highlighted and the previous sentence gets unhilighted.

 How: User inputs the reading text. My app puts that text through regex which outputs an array of sentences. The app stores the array of sentences and puts them into the html. Using css, a single 
 index which holds a sentence is highlighted. Whenever the user interacts with the scrren by scrolling up or down, or using the left and right arrow keys, the index is incremented 
 or decremented. The previous index with a sentence does not get highlighted or disappears and the new index with a sentence gets highlighted and appears. In addition, when 
 the user clicks on a sentence in the large text container, my app gets the index of that sentence. Then it will unhighlight the current highlighted sentence and highlight the 
 new sentence the user clicked on.

 What: User can read the sentence in another container where the sentence is in larger font. The font auto-adjusts so the entire text fits inside the container. The current sentence
 number is also displayed such as sentence 5 ouf of 20 sentences.
 How: Using the array mentioned above, my app gets the current index with a sentence and puts it in another container set to have large font. 
 Then it checks if the text is overflowing the container. If it overflows, the font will decrement until there is no more overflow. In addition, showing the current array index
 will indicate the current sentence number the user is on. Displaying the array length will show the total number of sentences in that text.

 What: User does not have to scroll manually. It is automatically done when the user reaches a sentence that is at the very top or very bottom of the text container element.
 How: As the user traverses through each of the sentences, page srolling up and down are done automatically when the single piece of text is outside the viewport. 
 
 
 What: With each sentence, pictures can be displayed for instance, to help visualize what's happening in the story and understand what emotion the reader should feel
 How: When the educator or interactive content maker inputs the text into my app to be processed and become interactive, the text can include for example: 
 [[ ㅁ farm.png - 1-6, 7, 8, 12-15, 58-69]] My app will then have farm.png appear whenever the user is on the following sentence array indices: 1-6, 7, 8, 12-15, 58-69. 




 Problem: when studying a language, students tend to overlook the material, not look up information because it's a hassle, and therefore not fully understand the material and develop bad habits.
 My app is automated and aesthetically pleasing in doing what students and teachers should be doing in the physical world but don't because it's not practical and it takes too much time.
 To solve all these problems, the learner/reader must use multiple physical tools such as bookmarks, magnifying glasses, and other sources or referecnes. Now everything can be done 
 digitally on a single screen which takes away unnecessary clutter and wasted time. My app allows an educator to reach every student and give them a 1-on-1 tutoring experience.




 Text manipulation
 What: Parts of the text are turned off and on like Christmas lights to emphasize grammar rules being applied in the text. For example in the sentence "I like to play but I should study",
 "to play" is an infinitive and "should study" is a helping verb followed by a base verb. The whole text is light gray. But when the user clicks on the 'infinitive' button, "to play" will turn pink.
 When the user clicks on the "Helping verb + base verb" button, "should study" will turn purple. The learner can see how these grammar rules are actually being applied in the reading material.
 How: Using regex, certain words are captured such as capturing "to" followed by another word but not if it's a pronoun, proper noun, or an article. 
 The result is, an infinitive is captured. These captured words can be styled with CSS.



 What: Vocabulary words/phrases can toggle to 1) the meaning embedded into the text, 2) synonyms, or 3) other languages, or anything else. Word can also mean phrases in this context.
 How: An object is created that hold a vocabulary word's properties such as the word itself, part of speech, definition, synonym, antonym, and Korean. These properties are also paired with a 
 boolean variable. For instace, the properties defintion, synonym, and Korean will have their partnered boolean variable. There will always be only one of the booleans set to be true while the rest are false.
 These objects are store in an array and later when the word becomes a span element, attributes of that word will be stored in the span. Those attributes are the sentence number that word the appears in and the array index in which that word resides. 
 Next, for each sentence,  every single index in the vocabulary array is iterated. With each iteration, it checks if the word's attribute which has the sentence number matches the current 
 sentence. If there  is a match, then will become a span element attached with an event listener. Whenever it gets activated, the boolean variables from the vocabulary word's object's 
 properties will toggle  from true to false and vice versa. The one that is true will mean it's paired/partnered word will be in the text. For instance, if the synonym boolean was set to true, 
 then the syonymn property will be displayed to the user.
 When vocabulary word/phrases are clicked, a picture/gif is displayed within the entire text and other containers. Interact with the picture such as a click and audio plays related to the text
 With mousedown and hold, float tags appear above or below the vocabulary word/phrase with extra details of that word/phrase.
 Notes can be written on the margins of the text.

 Interactive questions and answering
 Horizontal rectangular prisms spin on the z-axis. Each face has a part of the answer. User manipulates each prism until the desired answer is found when all the correct face of each prism are facing the viewer. 
 Cubes change colors and points are given to indicate to the users if that particular face has part of the correct or not.
 User can ask for answer justifications:
  - Wrong parts of the answers in the multiple choices are crossed out.
  - Parts of the text in the reading that mentions the answer are highlighted.
  - Float tags appear on the selected multiple choice card with detailed explanations.

grammar rule individually lights up, can combine, or have all on at once (appears in normal and magnified sentences)
simplify words(white and underlined) - toggles(in normal and magnified sentences, and lit up gm rules) to defn OR syn, OR Korean (meaning is embedded/melted into the text, same word can have different meanings, such as her strong 'drive' to succeed helped her 'drive' the team to victory.)
  - pics and gifs embedded in the text and appears near the clicked vocab

Reading questions
  - rotating cubes with parts of answers on each face
    - changes color to indicate correct or incorrect
    - text on face shrink and will be in one line. Only when it's too long even at min fontSize(13) will it go to the next line.
    - cubes can have variety of answers: letters -> words, words -> sentences, multiple choice questions, fill in the blank
    - cubeface can accept multiple correct answers
  - vertically resize of kUser-input with Q on as qText appears and disappears, container doesn't cover the text, the text container's length decreases so all text can still be read
  - pictures appear and disappear as mouse hovers and unhovers over buttons
  - wrong parts of the multiple choices are crossed out
    - default: whole wrong answer will be crossed out while the right answer has nothing crossed out.
  - text gets highlighted in blue to justify answers
    - blue and yellow highlighted sentences can overlap
  - Can see English and Korean explanation with floatTags that 
    - stays viewable until a multiple choice card is clicked

- can automatically be saved in localStorage



/* features: 1) Reading   2) lighting up words  3) toggling words    4) pictures     5) compQs
             
             Aesthetics:
             black: less strain on the eyes, easy to sees words lighting up, picture of space is relaxing, if too childish just have black, color of luxury
             auto scroll, auto find current sentence, vertically resize of kUser-input with Q on as qText appears and disappears
             when out of clientview and vocab clicked, auto view adjust to show vocab near the top of the clientHeight
             prism spins, go on its side, spin 90 deg on the z-axis to show logo, sun always appears, mouse pointer is a rocket and when mouse moves fire blasts off 
             sentence number displayed

             1) sentence isolation: hili sentence, background yellow, font black. (can be mixed with blue)arrows button, keyboard (can turn rapid fire off), auto scroll up/down,
                scroll bar part of design, click text, hili on/off with click
                magnify button, if hili off and traverse with mag, scroll doesn't move. With hili on, auto find spot, fontsize adjsuts, 
                sentence counter(for student: bookmark, seeing the end psychologically motivates you to keep going. For creator: handy tool, will explain later) right clicking magnify, 
                mag and hili connected, hili off and scroll down, then hili on and scroll auto finds the spot
                User can manually hili and unhili sentences
                  - highlight is a stronger yellow and persist throughout scrolling changing colors/vocab
                  - colors overlap with light/litUp sentence(very subtle) and blue justify sentences
             (for presentation: TURN MAG and HILI OFF)
             2) lightup words: ending off/on  works with hili too and MAG TOO. with mag you can see it slowly turns on
                grammar rule individually lights up, can combine, or do it all
             (TURN OFF EVERYTHING)
             3) simplify words(white and underlined) - toggles only defn OR syn, OR Korean.(meaning is embedded/melted into the text) POS and antonyms appear on floatTag(click and hold left/right click)
                same word can have different meanings, such as her 'drive' to succeed helped her 'drive' the team to victory.
                mouse click and hold for wordType/antonym. only displays wordType/antonym for word, not meaning, syn, or Korean. 
                  - spaceship/cursor disappears
                  - fontsize adjusts depending on the .vocab fontsize but no smaller than 13?18?, moves down if top has no space
                  - floatTag disappears with mouseleave or click
                  - wordType/antn can appear with newlines (creator can do this by acutally writing on a new line or using underscores a_b_c), essentially a list. 
                     This enables users to see all forms of the word: drive-base verb drove-past tense driving-present participle  driven-past participle  driven-adjective
                  - If vocab appears multiple times in a sentence, qText, or a mult. choice, all of the identical vocabs will be toggled simultaneously unless a music note is added to the 
                    word you don't want toggled. With the music note, the same word from the sentence, qText, or mult. choice can have different toggled info. 
                    issue choiceA has >>>[[urban agriculture - meaning..]]<<<     choiceB has >>>urban<<< agriculture. This will cause an issue. They're the same .vocab but it can't be cut off.
                    >>>urban<<< agriculture  -->   >>>urban agriculture<<< to match the declared vocab in choiceA. 
                    even if user write with extra spaces such as 'u♪rban       agriculture(1).webp', save file name as 'u♪rban agriculture(1).webp'
                    works with mag (lights up but instantly just to give a different feel from gm lighting up) and hili and gm but might slow down because it's doing so many calculations 
             (TURN OFF EVERYTHING)
             4) pics embedded in the text and appears near the clicked vocab, (all can be done by the creator), can also have gif files, 
                default pics available
                mag pic can be different even though the word is the same, if there is no diff pic, it will be the pic embedded in the text, if text if latch.png
                the code will attach latch.png and latch2.png. User must make sure there are 2 files (latch.png and latch2.png). If text is latch(noun).png then
                there must be 2 files: latch(noun).png and latch(noun)2.png
                mag default pic is different, pictures can turn on/off
                left pictures - background of story scene
                right pictures - character displaying emotion, click to see words of emotion and right click to change genders
                
             5) questions: container doesn't cover the text, the text container's length decreases so all text can still be read, 
                          magSent are now cubes, pics are unchanged in other words magSentL and magSentR has no changes
                          numbering Q numbers properly is important. The first Q brackets must be one, the 5th Q bracket must be 5 etc. Regardless of the number
                          the nth Q bracket will be read as the nth question. i.e. 1 2 3 133 4 5.  133 will be read as 4, 4 as 5 and 5 as 6
                        text can light up, simplify words can toggle:
                            - partial starting answer in qTextfor paraphrasing purposes, 
                            - cqaVocabs with not only single words but multiple words such as 'urban farming' or for idioms
                              + can have multiple spaces. 'urban     farming' but will be automatically condensed to a single space 
                              +  pics shown as well but only on hover. 
                              + if the vocab doesn't have a pic, don't add .png etc to it. If so an error msg will be displayed in the console but everything will still work
                              + In other words, don't add extension (.png) if there is no pic! 
                                If you do, the default pic will be assigned later but pic shows after an error and a no pic symbol may be briefly shown
                        cubes will have text that shrink and will be in one line. Only when it's too long even at min fontSize(13) will it go to the next line.
                        check answer: - cubes can have variety of answers: letters -> words, words -> sentences, multiple choice questions, fill in the blank 
                                      - answering with cubes force students to think of the answer then look for the answer by changing the cubes faces. This is closer
                                      to a free response answer but there is more control in what a student can output and the level of difficulty can be adjusted.
                                      As of now, students just see the answer and decide which is the right one.
                                      not case-sensitive, but spelling counts
                                      - cubeface can accept multiple correct answers if creator uses pipe(|) with multiple answers/words
                                      - creator cannot create more the 16 cubes. 16 is the maximum.
                                      - points won't be available if user looked at MC Qs first
                        justify answer - left click, text gets highlighted in blue. 
                                       - right clicked (cannot get points) wrong parts of the answer are crossed out. 
                                         >>><<< must be adjacent to letter. Creator must enclose entire .vocab in '>>><<<'. 
                                         i.e. >>>[[urban agriculture... ]]<<<  NOT >>>[[urban<<< agriculture... ]] 
                                         If del tags not inserted by the creator, the default will be the whole wrong answer will be crossed out while the right answer has nothing 
                                         crossed out.
                                      - Can see English and Korean explanation. Creator can use underscore to make newlines or actually hit enter to make a new line. 
                                        Will light up but no .vocabs  (it can be included did not on purpose). the reasoning is, this is not actual text but notes from the teacher,
                                        so teacher can use simple words or give defn. FloatTag won't disappear when mouse stops hovering. mult-choice card must be clicked to disappear
                        qPic disappears when mouseleaves, has a default if fileName has no .extension such as .jpg. But if it does have the extension but is not found, a backup default image will appear

Explanation:
html { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; }
→ This makes <html> act as a flex container and centers <body> both horizontally and vertically.
body { width: 96vw; height: 96vh; }
→ This ensures <body> has a set size, making it visibly centered.
margin: 0;
→ Prevents unwanted spacing from default margins.
Result:
✅ The body will be centered inside html, and its content will also be centered.
